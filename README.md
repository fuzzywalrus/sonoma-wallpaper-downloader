# The Sonoma Video Wallpaper Downloader

![Sonoma Video Wallpaper Downloader](http://blog.greggant.com/images/posts/2024-01-24-sonoma-downloader-v1.png)

I took inspiration from https://github.com/mikeswanson/WallGet, which is a Wallpaper downloader for macOS Sonoma that uses a Python script to trigger downloading all of the macOS Sonoma video wallpapers.

However, I wanted to do something a bit different and allow users to download the individual wallpapers and save them wherever they would like. 

# Important: This app requires Sonoma or later to function properly!

This application is dependent on reading the system preference files to grab a current list of the available video wallpapers.

## Downloading the App

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/fuzzywalrus/sonoma-wallpaper-downloader/releases) and download either the ZIP or DMG file. It's a universal binary, so it'll work on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.
